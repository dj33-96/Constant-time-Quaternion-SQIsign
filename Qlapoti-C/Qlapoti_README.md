# SQIsign C implementation using qlapoti


This library is a C implementation of SQIsign, modified to use the new qlapoti algorithm for the ideal-to-isogeny translation step. 

## Differences to the SQIsign NIST round 2 submission

Differences compared to the state of [the SQIsign team's repo](https://www.github.com/SQIsign/the-sqisign) accessed on April 30, 2025.

- Replaced the implementation of the function dim2id2iso_ideal_to_isogeny_clapotis in file src/id2iso/ref/lvlx/dim2id2so.c by a new Qlapoti-based version and removing the dependencies of the old version. This results in an almost full rewrite off the file.
- In folder src/id2iso/ref/lvlx/test adaptation of the tests in dim2id2iso_test.c, test_dim2id2iso.c and test_id2iso_test.c, addition of benchmarking files dim2id2iso_benchmarks.c and qlapoti_normeq_benchmarks.c
- Adaptation of src/id2iso/ref/lvlx/lvlx_test.cmake to compile the new benchmarking files.
- Addition of a new constant for QUAT_cornacchia_extended_params in src/id2iso/ref/include/id2iso.h
- In the scripts/precomp folder, adapt the files parameters.py, precompute_quaternion_constants.sage and precompute_quaternion_data.sage to remove the computation of additional orders and add the computation of parameters for the extended cornacchia algoritm.
- In the src/precomp folder, overwrite all files with the output of the scripts in scripty/precomp by running `make precomp`
- In the src/quaternion/ref/generic folder, add a file qlapoti.c containing the norm equation solving qlapoti algorithm. Add tests for all functions in this file in a file in test/qlapoti.c in the same folder, and make sure these tests are called from test_quaternions.c. Adapt CMakeLists.txt in this folder and the test/ folder it contains to compile these files. Add the public-facing quat_qlapoti function to quaternion.h, as well as the type definition for ibz_cornacchia_extended_params_t it requires and the headers of a few functions useful for testing in id2iso (quat_alg_elem_set, quat_lideal_equals, quat_lideal_mul, quat_alg_elem_equal).
- In the files intbig.h and intbig.c, the argument to ibz_two_adic was made constant.
- qlapoti needs some additional lower-level functions, which are added in the files where they fit best within the src/quaternion/ref/generic folder. For each of them, tests were added in the corresponding file in the src/quaternion/ref/generic/test/ folder, and headers in one of the header files in  src/uaternion/ref/internal_quaternion_headers/, if not in quaternion.h.
  - dim2.c ibz_2x2_mul, ibz_mat_2x2_inv_with_det_as_denom
  - intbig.c ibz_cornacchia_extended and its dependencies ibz_cornacchia_extended_prime_loop, ibz_complex_mul_by_complex_power, ibz_complex_mul
  - The file rationals.c was moved from the hnf subfolder to the quaternion/ref/generic base folder, and all headers, inclusions and CmakeLists adapted accordingly.
- For compiling, one line in .cmake/target was changed to "if (UNIX AND NOT APPLE)" from "if (UNIX)".
- This README is entirely new, and the README of the SQIsign NIST round 2 implementation is copied to SQIsign_README.md


## Replicating our experimental results

- Use a machine meeting the requirements of SQIsign's Round 2 NIST submission as stated in the requirements section of the SQIsign_README.md file.
- Create a folder build/ inside C-implementation
- Inside build/, run `cmake -DSQISIGN_BUILD_TYPE=ref -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..` (optionally choose your C compiler by the flag `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER`), then run `make`. No errors nor warnings should show.
- For benchmarks of the full SQIsign signature, go into build/apps and run `./benchmark_lvl1 --iterations=<number of iterations>`. Change lvl1 to lvl3 or lvl5 for the other levels.
- For benchmarks of idiso only, go into build/src/id2iso/ref/lvl1/test and run `./sqisign_id2iso_benchmark_dim2id2iso_lvl1 --iterations=<number of iterations>`. Change lvl1 to lvl3 or lvl5 for the other levels.
- For heap memory usage, go into build/test and then run `valgrind -tool=massif ./sqisign_test_scheme_lvl1` then visualize the result by calling `ms-print` on the output file massif.out.<process-id>. For averaging, it is recommended to script generating and parsing the outputs. Change lvl1 to lvl3 or lvl5 for the other levels.
- We also provide a tool for benchmarking the equation solving part of qlapoti separately from the isogeny computations. This can be done by running `./sqisign_id2iso_benchmark_qlapoti_normeq_lvl1 --iterations=<number of iterations>` in build/src/id2iso/ref/lvl1/test. Change lvl1 to lvl3 or lvl5 for the other levels.
- For comparison, follow the exact same procedure in the SQIsign/the-sqisign repo's version from April 2025. The files sqisign_id2iso_benchmark_qlapoti_normeq and sqisign_id2iso_benchmark_dim2id2iso_lvl1 do not exist in that version. While the former is meaningless in that context, the latter can be copied into that codebase and made to compile with only minimal changes to some id2iso and quaternion files (essentially modifying lvlx_test.cmake in the src/id2iso/ref/lvlx/ folder to compile the new file, and make the function it depends on available to it, either by copying there headers into public header files if they are not yet there, or by copying them from the qlapoti code).
- For rerunning the precomputations, run `make precomp` in the build folder (after cmake and make). This requires a very recent version of SageMath (10.5 for example). To use your new precomp files, re-run `make` afterwards.
- To use or compile the code in other ways, please use the SQIsign NIST Round 2 README, provided in the SQIsign_README.md file.
